# DETECTING-AI-GENERATED-PRODUCT-REVIEWS-USING-LLM-ALGORITHM

The detection of AI-generated product reviews is a complex task due to the increased use of large language models (LLMs) and their capability to generate convincing sentences. The AI-generated reviews can affect the consumers and businesses as they influence the trust and decision-making. This project investigates the differentiation between human-written and AI-generated texts through the analysis of linguistic features automatically extracted by an online computational tool. Utilizing a diverse set of phonological, morphological, syntactic, and lexical constituents, the research highlights significant variations between the two types of texts. This project is aimed at addressing the growing concern of AI-generated product reviews, specifically in both Dravidian languages such as Malayalam and Tamil, and English. As AI tools become more advanced, the ability to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated content has become increasingly crucial, especially in the domain of online reviews where authenticity is essential for consumer decision-making. The proposed model with LLM algorithm provides both document-level and sentence-level text detection through Instruction Tuning indicating that the model has good detection and classification ability for AI generated text.
